        <h3 id='vars'>Varibales</h3>
        <p>
          In ECMAScript variables are loosely typed, meaining that a variable can hold any type
          of data. Every variable is simply a named placeholder for a value. To define a variable,
          use the <b>var</b> operator(note that <b>var</b> is a keyword) followed by the variable
          name (an identifier, as described earlier), like this: <code class='white'>var message;</code>
        </p>
        <p>
          This code defines a variable named <b>message</b> that can be used to hold any value.
          (Without initialization, it holds a special value <b>undefined</b> which will be discussed
          in the next section.) ECMAScript implements variable initialization, so it's possible to
          define and set it's value at the same time, as in this example:<br>
        </p>
          <pre class='prettyprint code'>var message = "Hi!";</pre>
        <p>
          Here, <b>message</b> is defined to hold a string value of <em>"Hi!".</em>
          Doing this initialization doesn't mark the variable as being a string type;
          it's simply the assignment of a value to the variable. It is still possible
          not only to change the value stored in the variable but also change it's data
          type (which is possible but not incouraged) like this:
        </p>

        <pre class='prettyprint code'>var message = 'Hi!';<br> <b>message = 100;</b> // legal but not recommended.</pre>

        <p>
          It's important to not that using the <b>var</b> operator to define a variable makes it local
          to the scope in which it was defined. For example, defining a variable inside a function using
          <b>var</b> means that the variable is destroyed as soon as the function exits, as shown here:
        </p>

        <pre class='prettyprint code'>function test () {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; var message = 'hi';<br>}</pre>
        <pre class='prettyprint code'>test()<br>alert(message)// error, message is not accessible.</pre><br /><br />

        <pre class='prettyprint code'>function test () {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; message = 'hi';<br>}<br></pre>
        <pre class='prettyprint code'>test()<br>alert(message)// hi, because message is now a global variable.</pre><br /><br />
        <p>By removing the <code class='white'>var</code> from the function, message is now a global variable and is accessible outside the function.</p>

        <h3 id='data-type'>Data Types</h3>
        <p>
          There are 5 simple data types(also called <em>primative types</em>) in ECMAScript:
          <em>Undefined, Null, Boolean, Number</em> and <em> String</em>. There is also a
          complex data type called <b>Object</b>, which is an unordered list of name-value pairs.
          Because there is no way to define your own data types in ECMAScript, all values can be
          represented as one of these 6 data types. Having only 6 data types may seem like too
          few to fully represent data; however, ECMAScript's data types have <b>dynamic</b> aspects
          that make each single data type behave like several.
        </p>

        <h3 id='typeof'>The typeof operator</h3>
        <p>
          Because ECMAScript is loosly typed, there needs to be a way to determine the data type of a
          given variable. The <code class='white'>typeof</code> operator provides that information Using <b>typeof</b>
          on a value returns on of the following strings:
        </p>
          <ul>
            <li><code class='white'>"undefined"</code> if the value is undefined.</li>
            <li><code class='white'>"boolean"</code> if the value is a Boolean.</li>
            <li><code class='white'>"string"</code> if the value is a string.</li>
            <li><code class='white'>"number"</code> if the value is a number</li>
            <li><code class='white'>"object"</code> if the value is an object (other than a function) or null.</li>
            <li><code class='white'>"function"</code> if the value is a function.</li>
          </ul>
        <p>
          The <b>typeof</b> operator is called like this:
        </p>
          <script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8">
            var message = 'some string';
            var myFunc  = function(name) { return 'Hello there, ' + name; };
            console.log('typeof message: ' + typeof message);
            console.log('typeof(message)' + typeof (message));
            console.log('typeof 95' + typeof 95);
            console.log('typeof myFunc' + typeof myFunc);
          </script>
          <pre class='prettyprint code'>var message = 'some string';
var myFunc = function (name){ return 'Hello there '+ name;  }
console.log(typeof message); // 'string'
console.log(typeof(message)); // 'string'
console.log(typeof 95); // 'number'
console.log(typeof myFunc); // 'function'
          </pre>
        <p>
          Note that because <b>typeof</b> is an operator and not a function,
          no parentheses are required (although they can be used).
        </p>
        <p>
          Be aware that the <b>typeof</b> operator can return confusing results.
          Calling <b>typeof</b> null returns a value of "<b>object</b>" is returned.
          Technically, functions are considered <em>Objects</em> in ECMAScript but
          when <b>typeof</b> is called on a function, "<b>function</b>" is returned
        </p>

        <h3 id='undefined'>The Undefined Type</h3>
        <p>The Undefined type has only one value, which is the special value <code class='white'>undefined</code></p>
          <pre class="prettyprint code">var message;<br />console.log(message == undefined)</pre>
        <script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8">
          var message = undefined;
          console.log('message == undefined '+ (message == undefined));
        </script>
        <p>So declaring a variable but not setting it's value will give you an <code class="white">undefined</code>
         value. Trying to access a variable that hasn't been defined will throw an error.</p>
        <pre class='prettyprint code'>console.log(message);// undefined <br />console.log(age);// age is not defined</pre>
        <script>console.log('this is console.log(age)'+ age);// age is not defined</script>
        <p>The <code class="white">typeof</code> operator returns '<code class="white">undefined</code>'
        when called on an uninitialized variable, but also returns <code class="white">"undefined"</code>
        when called on an undeclared variable, which can be a bit confusing.</p>

        <h3 id='null'>The Null Type</h3>
        <p>The Null type is the second data type that has only one value:
        the special value <code class="white">null</code>. Logically, a
        <code class="white">null</code> value is an empty object pointer,
        which is why <code class="white">typeof</code> returns <code class="white">
        "object"</code> when it's passed a <code class="white">null</code> value
        in the following example: </p>
        <pre class='prettyprint code'>var car = null;
console.log(typeof car);// "object"
        </pre>
        <script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8">
          var car = null;
          console.log('console.log(typeof car) '+ typeof car);
        </script>
        <p>When defining a variable that is meant to later hold an object, it
        is advisable to initialize the variable to <code class="white">null</code>
         to determine if the variable has been filled with an object reference
        at a later time, such as in this example: </p>
        <pre class='prettyprint code'>if (car != null) {<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;// do something with car <br />}</pre>
        <p>The value <code class="white">undefined</code> is a derivative of <code class="white">
        null</code>, so ECMA-262 defines them to be superficially equal as follows:</p>
        <p><code class='prettyprint code'>console.log(null == undefined)// true</code></p>
        <p>Using the equality operator (==) between <b>null</b> and <b>undefined</b>
        always return <b>true</b>, though keep in mind that this operator converts its
        operands for comparison purposes</p>
        <p>Even though <b>null</b> and <b>undefined</b> are related, they have
        very different uses. As mentioned previously, you should never explicitly
        set the value of a variable to <code class="white">undefined</code>,
        but the same does not hold true for <code class="white">null</code>
        Any time an object is expected but is not available, <b>null</b>
        should be used in its place. This helps keep the paradigm of <code class="white">null</code>
        as an empty object pointer and further differentiates it from <code class="white">undefined</code>.</p>

        <h3 id='boolean'>The Boolean Type</h3>
        <p>The Boolean type is one of the most frequently used types in ECMAScript and has only
        two literal values: <b>true</b> and <b>false</b>. These values are distinct from numeric
        values, so <b>true</b> is not equal to <b>1</b>, and <b>false</b> is not equal to
        <b>0</b>. Assignment of Boolean values to variables is as follows: </p>
        <p><code class='prettyprint code'>var found = true;<br />var lost = false;</code></p>
        <p>Note that the Boolean literals <b>true</b> and <b>false</b> are case-sensitive,
        so <b>True</b> and <b>False</b> (and other mixings of uppercase and lowercase) are
        valid as identifiers but not as Boolean values.</p>
        <p>Though there are just two literal Boolean values, all types of values have
        Boolean equivalents in ECMAScript. To convert a value into its Boolean equivalent,
        the specail <code class="white">Boolean()</code> casting function is called, like this: </p>
        <p><code class='prettyprint code'>var message = 'Hello, JavaScript!';<br />var messageAsBoolean = Boolean(message);</code></p>
        <p>In this example, the string <b>message</b> is converted into a Boolean value and stored
        in <code class="white">messageAsBoolean</code>. The <code class="white">Boolean()</code>
        casting function can be called on any type of data and will always return a Boolean value.
        The rules for when a value is converted to <code class="white">true</code> or
        <code class="white">false</code> depend on the data type as much as the actual value.</p>
        <script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8">
          var message = 'Hello JavaScript!';
          console.log('console.log(message) ' + message);
          var messageAsBoolean = Boolean(message);
          console.log('console.log(messageAsBoolean) ' + messageAsBoolean);
        </script>
        <p>These conversions are important to understand because flow-control
        statements, such as the <code class="white">if</code> statement,
        automatically perform this Boolean conversion, as shown here: </p>
        <p><code class='prettyprint code'>var message = 'I love JavaScript';<br />if (message) { <br />&nbsp;
          &nbsp; console.log('Value is true');<br />}</code></p>
        <p>In this example, the console log will be displayed because the string
        <code class="white">message</code> is automatically converted into its
        Boolean equivalent (true). It's important to understand what variable you're
        using in a flow-control statement because of this automatic conversion. Mistakenly
        using an object instead of a Boolean can drastically alter the flow of your application.</p>

        <h3 id="num">The Number Type</h3>
        <p>
          The Number type is perhaps the most interesting data type in ECMAScript, which uses the
          IEEE-754 format to represent both integers and floating point values (also called double-
          percision values in some languages). To support the various types of numbers, there are
          several different number literal formats.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most basic number literal format is that of a decimal integer, which can be entered directly
          as shown here:
        </p>
        <p><code class='prettyprint code'>var intNum = 55; // integer</code></p>
        <p>Integers can also be represented as either octal (base 8) or hexidecimal (base 16) literals.
         For an octal literal, the first digit must be a zero(0) followed by a sequence of octal digits
        (numbers 0 - 7). If a number is out of this range is detected in the literal, then the leading
        zero is ignored and the number is treated as a decimal, as in the following examples: </p>
        <p><code class='prettyprint code'>var octalNum1 = 070; // octal for 56 <br />var octalNum2 = 079; // invalid octal - interpreted as 79
        <br />var octalNum3 = 08; // invalid octal = interpreted as 8</code></p>
        <script>
          var octalNum1 = 070;
          console.log('var octalNum1 = 070 is octal '+ octalNum1);
          var octalNum2 = 077;
          console.log('var octalNum2 = 077 is octal ' + octalNum2);
          var octalNum3 = 079;
          console.log('var octalNum3 = 079 is not an octal number because the number is out of octal range '+ octalNum3);
        </script>
        <p>Octal literals are invalid when running in strict mode and will cause a syntax error.</p>
        <p>
          To create a hexadecimal literal, you must make the first 2 characters 0x(case sensitive)
          followed by any number of hexadecimal digits (0 - 9, and A - F). Letters may be in upper or lower
          case. Here's an example:
        </p>
        <p><code class='prettyprint code'>var hexNum1 = 0xA;// 10<br />var hexNum2 = 0x1f;// 31</code></p>
        <script>
          var hexNum1 = 0xA;
          console.log('hexNum1 = 0xA is hexadecimal '+ hexNum1);
          var hexNum2 = 0x1f;
          console.log('hexNum1 = 0x1f is hexadecimal '+ hexNum2);
        </script>
        <p>
        Numbers created using hexadecimal or octal format are treated
        ad decimal numbers in all arithmetic operations.
        </p>

        <h5>Floating-Point Values</h5>
        <p>
          To define a floating-point value, you must include a decimal point and
          at least one number after the decimal point. Although an integer is not
          necessary before a decimal point, it is recommended. Here are some
          examples:
        </p>
        <p>
          <code class='prettyprint code'>var floatNum1 = 1.1;<br />var floatNum2 = 0.1;<br />var floatNum3 = .1;// valid but not recommended</code>
        </p>
        <p>
          Because storing floating-point values uses twice as much memory as storing integer values,
          ECMAScript always looks for ways to convert values into integers. When there is no digit
          after the decimal point, the number becomes an integer. Likewise, if the number being
          represented is a whole number (such as 1.0), it will be converted into an integer, as
          in this example:
        </p>
        <code class='prettyprint code'>
          var floatNum1 = 1.;// missing digit after the decimal - interperted as integer 1<br>
          var floatNum2 = 10.0;// whole number - interpreted as integer 10
        </code>
